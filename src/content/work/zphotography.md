Outside of my normal work, I am a freelance wedding and events photographer. I provide clients with a guest-eye view of their wedding or event, allowing them to relive the day with candid photos that capture the heart of the event. I have succeeded if follow my two golden rules.

**Golden Rules of Events Photography**
- Don't be the story : _You are there to capture someone else's day. Keep it theirs, don't insert yourself into it._
- Capture their story : _Tell the story, its key moments and its emotions with your images. Let your client live it again and again._
