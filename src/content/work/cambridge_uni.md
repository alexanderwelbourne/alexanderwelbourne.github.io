\
Strain-mediated voltage control of magnetic systems is an under-explored, but rich avenue of research with promise for ultra-low-energy next-generation computing devices. My PhD broke ground demonstrating the potential for strain control of advanced magnetic systems as a rewarding avenue of study.

**Impact and Dissemination**
- Thesis, _“Strain control of advanced magnetic systems for spintronic applications”_, published [online](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.81785) with over 40 downloads.
- MOKE image analysis app published [online](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72494-moke-image-analysis). Over 70 downloads.

**Innovation & Design**
- Demonstrated strain-controlled spintronic devices for next-gen computing applications.
- Authored software for advanced image analysis with GUI for broader usability in the research community.

**Mentorship & Outreach**
- Supervised undergraduate and master’s students, fostering technical and theoretical skills.
- Delivered core supervisions for physics undergraduates, leading one student to achieve a top-15 ranking.
