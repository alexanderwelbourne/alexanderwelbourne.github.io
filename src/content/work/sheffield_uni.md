A series of projects on novel spintronic-based AI/ML devices working cross-discipline between Computer Science and Materials Science at the University of Sheffield. The drive behind this work has been
developing physics-rich hardware for machine learning and the software to run on it. Particular highlights have been demonstrating a proof of principle neural network with a novel stochastic learning rule running on new hardware (magnetic binary stochastic synapses) and developing a new computational research thread for edge ML hardware, “Voltage-controlled superparamagnetic
ensembles for low-power reservoir computing”.
